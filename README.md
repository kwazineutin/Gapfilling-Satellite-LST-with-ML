# Gapfilling-Satellite-LST-with-ML

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and associated files for different stages of the project Gap-filling Satellite Land Surface Temperature Over Heatwave Periods with Machine Learning by 
Isaac Buo, Valentina Sagris, and Jaak Jaagus.

We explore the suitability of machine learning as a gap-filling tool for satellite land surface tempereature. Because heatwaves have a limited temporal frame, having a full and cloud-free complement of LST for that period is necessary

Key tools:
Sklearn
Rasterio
Geopandas
Geotools
GEEtools

Data and Sources:
Elevation and land use data -Estonian Landboard Geoportal 
1 km Grid - Estonian Statistical Service
MODIS LST and NDVI - Google Earth Engine
